  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I am working on my PhD at Caltech, advised by <a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Perona.html">Pietro Perona</a>. My PhD is funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I did my BS at Seattle University where I was advised by <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/scieng/ece/faculty-and-staff/agnieszka-miguel-phd.html">Agnieszka Miguel</a>. My research work focuses on machine learning and computer vision for biodiversity monitoring, particulary for detection and recognition of animal species in challenging camera trap data at a global scale. I work closely with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth">Microsoft AI for Earth</a> where I help put my research into production.</p>

  I'm an ex-professional ballerina, ask me for dance recommendations!
